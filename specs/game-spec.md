# Up and Down the River

*Also known as: Oh Hell, Oh Pshaw, Nomination Whist, Blackout, Blob*

## Overview

"Up and Down the River" is a trick-taking card game where players bid on how many tricks they believe they can win in each hand. The key challenge is that players must win *exactly* the number of tricks they bid - no more and no fewer - to score maximum points. The game follows a pattern of dealing a decreasing number of cards and then an increasing number of cards (hence the name "Up and Down the River").

## Players

- **Number of Players**: 3-7 players (best with 4-6)
- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck (no jokers)

## Card Ranking

- **High to Low**: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
- **Trump**: A suit designated for each hand that outranks all other suits

## Game Structure

The game consists of multiple hands. The number of cards dealt to each player changes with each hand, following this pattern:

1. Start with a set number of cards (depends on player count)
2. Decrease by one card each hand until reaching one card per player
3. Increase by one card each hand until returning to the starting number

### Starting Card Count

The maximum number of cards dealt per player depends on the number of players:
- 3 to 5 players: 10 cards each
- 6 players: 8 cards each
- 7 players: 7 cards each

### Hand Sequence Examples

- **With 4 players**: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (19 hands total)
- **With 7 players**: 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (13 hands total)

A full game typically takes about 45 minutes to complete.

## Setup and Dealing

1. **Choose First Dealer**: Players draw cards; highest card deals first
2. **Deal Cards**: Deal the appropriate number of cards for the current hand
3. **Determine Trump**: Turn over the next card after dealing to determine the trump suit
4. **Trump Card Placement**: Place the trump card face-up on top of the remaining deck

## Game Play

### Bidding Phase

1. Bidding begins with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise
2. Each player must bid the exact number of tricks they think they will win (0 is a valid bid)
3. The dealer bids last and has a special restriction: The dealer cannot bid a number that would make the total bids equal the total number of tricks available in the hand
4. This "hook" ensures that at least one player will fail to make their bid in each hand
5. Players can change their bid only if the next player has not yet bid

### Playing Phase

1. The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick
2. Play proceeds clockwise
3. Players must follow the suit led if possible
4. If unable to follow suit, a player may play any card (including trump)
5. Highest card of the suit led wins the trick, unless a trump is played, in which case the highest trump wins
6. The winner of each trick leads the next trick
7. Continue until all tricks are played

## Scoring

There are several common scoring variations:

### Standard Scoring

- **Making Exact Bid**: 10 points + 1 point per trick taken
- **Missing Bid**: 0 points (regardless of how many tricks actually taken)

### Alternative Scoring #1 (Simple)

- **Making Exact Bid**: 10 points + number of tricks bid (e.g., bidding 3 and taking exactly 3 tricks scores 13 points)
- **Missing Bid**: 0 points

### Alternative Scoring #2 (Common)

- **All Players**: 1 point per trick taken (regardless of bid)
- **Making Exact Bid**: Additional 10 point bonus

### Alternative Scoring #3 (Penalty)

- **Making Exact Bid**: 10 points + 1 point per trick taken
- **Missing Bid**: -1 point per trick over or under the bid

## Special Rules

1. **Zero Bid**: When bidding zero, the player aims to take no tricks at all
2. **Scribe/Scorekeeper**: Designate a player to record bids and scores for each hand
3. **No-Trump Hands**: If all cards in the deck are dealt in a hand, that hand may be played without a trump suit

## Strategy Tips

1. **Bidding Strategy**: The most critical part of the game is the bidding process
2. **Zero Bids**: Don't be afraid to bid zero, even on rounds with many cards per player
3. **Card Counting**: Count cards on high-card rounds to get a feel for other players' hands
4. **Force Wins**: You can deliberately force a player to win a trick when they are at their bid amount
5. **Dealer Position**: The dealer's position offers both advantages and disadvantages due to the "hook" rule

## Variations

1. **Simultaneous Bidding**: Players bid simultaneously by extending fingers representing their bid
2. **Progressive Trump**: The trump suit changes according to a fixed rotation with each hand
3. **Fixed Hand Count**: Some variants play a fixed number of hands rather than going "up and down"
4. **Team Play**: Players can form teams, combining their individual scores

## Game End

The game ends after completing all hands in the sequence. The player with the highest total score wins.
